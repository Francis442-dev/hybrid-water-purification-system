Hybrid Water Purification System (HWPS)
The Hybrid Water Purification System (HWPS) is a low-cost, modular treatment prototype that uses:
Adsorption: biochar + rice-husk ash
Filtration: stratified sand and gravel.
The goal is to build an affordable, replicable purifier for communities facing contaminated surface or borehole water.

Features:
Low-cost, locally sourced materials;
Modular design for easy scaling;
Simple fabrication process;
Targets turbidity, colour, and basic organic contaminants.

/models — sketches, layer configurations, flow calculations
/prototype — build steps, materials, assembly
/experiments — water tests, turbidity results, logs
/python — simple simulation and flow-rate tools

Current Status
Research and design phase in progress.
Prototype development begins once water access is available.
